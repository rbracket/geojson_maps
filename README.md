geojson_maps
============

This includes first experiments with geojson on github.  

Ramps. intersections are related to discovering curb ramps in the Lloyd District in Portland, Oregon.

The building file is a first foray into spatial joins.  The joined data sets are from a download of building footprints from civic
apps and an Openstreetmap export of a similar extent.  Other pre-processing, transforms should be documented.
